 * Pokémon are the creatures that inhabit the world of the Pokémon games.

 * Each Pokémon belongs to a specific species but may take on a variant
 * which makes it differ from other Pokémon of the same species, such as base stats, available abilities and typings.
 * - See [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(species)) for greater detail.
