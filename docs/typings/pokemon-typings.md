# Pokemons

## Pokemon

Pokémon are the creatures that inhabit the world of the Pokémon games.
They can be caught using Pokéballs and trained by battling with other Pokémon.
Each Pokémon belongs to a specific species but may take on a variant
which makes it differ from other Pokémon of the same species, such as base stats, available abilities and typings.
