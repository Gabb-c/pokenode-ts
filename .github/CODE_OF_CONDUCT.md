# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make our community a harassment-free environment for all people, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We agree to act and engage in ways that promote an open, accepting, varied, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are accountable for explaining and upholding our norms of acceptable behavior, and they will take appropriate and equitable corrective action in response to any behavior that they consider improper, threatening, disrespectful, or damaging.

Community leaders have the authority and obligation to remove, alter, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, problems, and other contributions that do not comply with this Code of Conduct, and they will express the reasons for moderation choices when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community areas, as well as to those who are formally representing the community in public venues. Using an official email address, publishing on an official social media account, or serving as a designated representative at an online or offline event are all examples of how we represent our community.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at <conduct@example.com>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

To ensure privacy and security, all community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will use these Community Impact Guidelines to determine the repercussions of any activity they believe violates this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of foul language or other behavior that is judged unprofessional or unacceptable in the community.

**Consequence**: A confidential, written warning from community leaders, clarifying the nature of the offense and explaining why the behavior was improper. A public apology might be demanded.

**Community Impact**: A transgression committed in a single occurrence or set of activities.

**Consequence**: A warning, with repercussions for continuing conduct. No contact with individuals implicated, including unwanted contact with personnel enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a set length of time.
